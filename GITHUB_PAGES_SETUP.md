# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Go to your repository**: 
   - Visit: https://github.com/adamrgarcia80/cymatics

2. **Click "Settings"**:
   - It's in the top menu bar of your repository (next to "Code", "Issues", etc.)

3. **Scroll down to "Pages"**:
   - Look in the left sidebar menu
   - Click on "Pages"

4. **Configure the source**:
   - Under "Source", click the dropdown that says "None"
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Under "Branch":
     - Branch: Select `main`
     - Folder: Select `/ (root)`
   - Click "Save"

5. **Wait for deployment**:
   - You'll see a message: "Your site is live at https://adamrgarcia80.github.io/cymatics/"
   - It may take 1-2 minutes for the first deployment
   - Refresh the page - you'll see a green checkmark when it's ready

6. **Access your site**:
   - URL: https://adamrgarcia80.github.io/cymatics/
   - Note: It might take a few minutes to be accessible the first time

## Troubleshooting

- **"Site not found"**: Make sure you've completed step 4 above and waited a few minutes
- **404 Error**: Make sure `index.html` is in the root folder (it is!)
- **Still not working**: Check the "Actions" tab - there might be a deployment error

## Alternative: Check Current Status

Visit this URL to check if Pages is enabled:
https://github.com/adamrgarcia80/cymatics/settings/pages

If you see a "Pages" section with settings, it should work. If you see "This repository doesn't have GitHub Pages enabled", follow the steps above.
